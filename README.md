# Teaching
A repository of material created for teaching first year computer science at UNSW.

## Introduction
This is a static website, with other materials created to host material I've written as part of tutoring at UNSW. Though I have some plans to make this more dynamic, perhaps with cgi, or node.js I'm happy with the current build's simplicity.

## Hosting
Hosting is down on surge, through surge.sh. The site is currently live [here](http://unsw-lab.surge.sh/).

## Rendering
All rendering is done with the apple software macdown, which renders markdown to html with customisable css.

## Collaborators
Hoping to get assistant tutors involved throughout this semester and next to add more content! If you're interested hit me up.

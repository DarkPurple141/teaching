# Teaching
A repository of material created for teaching first year computer science at UNSW.

## Introduction
This is a static website, with other materials created to host material I've written as part of tutoring at UNSW (this project however has no affiliation). Though I have some plans to make this more dynamic in the future, perhaps with cgi, or node.js I'm happy with the current build's simplicity.

## Contributing
To contribute you can simply make a fork, make your changes in your own branch, and request a pull request merge into master. I'll be generous with any changes as long as they're in the spirit of the project.

### Notes with formatting:
* Notes/Articles should be lodged in the \_notes directory and should use the template markdown from the \_generic.md starter file.
* Any code files should go in the appropriate lab/week* sub-folder, or if no such lab is relevant, a new folder under the labs subdirectory.

## Hosting
Hosting is done on surge, through surge.sh. The site is currently live [here](http://unsw-lab.surge.sh/).

## Rendering
All rendering is done with a combination of [prism](https://github.com/PrismJS) (code rendering), and modified jekyll-based css. All files are written in a combination of markdown, html with [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki), and jekyll-ified markdown.

## Collaborators
Hoping to get assistant tutors involved throughout this semester and next to add more content! If you're interested hit me up.
